Your response goes here!

I learned some new elements such as <s>, <figure>, and <hr> that I didn't know before. I took a basic E-Commerce university course and a CodeAcademy HTML course but there is still a lot of HTML I have yet to learn. Most of the lessons were easy due to this previous knowledge. Nothing has really been difficult so far. I used online resources such as Google, StackOverflow, Wikipedia, and the MDN documentation in order to fill in the gaps in knowledge. I will continue with the same process in future challenges.
